# Introduction to FCC Ottawa Group Project

## The Project
**We are creating a website for the freeCodeCamp Ottawa meetup.** This allows us to combine our powers, given our varying levels of experience and familiarity with programming languages, frameworks, libraries and other technologies. 

## Website Content
The website will be a dynamic, multi-page site that centres around our meetup group. While there are multiple possibilities for what we can include, at a minimum the site will consist of: 
* Landing page with navigation bar
* About Us page, with information about our meetup, our vision, and projects
* Blog/news page for group updates 
* Resources page for links to articles, handy tips, member-written tutorials or screencasts, videos, self-care tips - endless possibilities! 
* Contact Us form

## Why get involved? 
- [x] Practise using GitHub and working collaboratively - essentially a **simulation of working in a professional development team**
- [x] Work on an **open source** project - yes, this counts! 
- [x] Everyone can contribute, regardless of experience or programming level
- [x] Build your portfolio and resume - contribution to open source, community, and real-world projects
- [x] Most importantly - **challenge yourself, take initiative, and learn something new**! 

## Production 
We will strive to build the [minimum viable product (MVP) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)to get our site up and running.

Initially, we will be working as a group on setting up the basic elements of the website - the _landing page_, _About Us_ page, and _Contact_ form.

As the website grows and the need for more specialised technology arises, we will split into teams/pairs to work on different sections of the site, based on individual knowledge and experience. 

Members will contribute to the project **remotely**, and each meetup will include time allocated to evaluating the site's progress and direction going forward.

Minutes from each meetup will also be added to the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/laurenmayers/fccOttawa/wiki), for those unable to attend (Thanks to Steven Adema).

## Getting started 
1. Read the project [README.md](https://github.com/laurenmayers/fccOttawa/blob/fcc-readme-1/README.md) (and please contribute)!
2. Check the **project board** under the [Projects](https://github.com/laurenmayers/fccOttawa/projects) tab, to see what needs to be done, what is underway, and what is completed (if you don't have access, please contact me - I will add you as a collaborator).
3. Clone the repository to your account and create a new branch for your contributions. 
4. Add any ideas to the 'To Dos' on the project board. 
5. **Join our communities** - [Slack](https://fcc-ottawa.slack.com) channel, and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.ottawa/) group. 

# Happy coding!
