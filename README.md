# Project Overview 
This is a collaborative project between the members of the freeCodeCamp Ottawa meetup. 
We are creating a freeCodeCamp Ottawa website. The website will contain information about our group, links to resources and tutorials, an 'about' section, and a forum. 

# Getting Started
As a collaborator, you will be able to work on any component of the website. 
The project plans are displayed in the 'Projects' tab of this repository: 

- View the items in the 'To Do' list to see what needs to be done 
- Move any items on which you're working across into the 'In Progress' tab
- The task will be moved to 'Done' once the code is merged into the master branch. 

# How to Contribute
See what needs to be done within the Projects tab, and what is currently in progress. Consider what might be best task to follow on from those already completed, or what your particular strengths might be.

Clone the repository to your account and create a new branch for your contributions. 
Commit the changes and push to GitHub. Create a pull request to submit changes for review.
