# freeCodeCamp [Ottawa] website

## Project overview 
This is a collaborative project between the members of the freeCodeCamp Ottawa meetup. 
We are creating a freeCodeCamp Ottawa website. The website will contain information about our group, links to resources and tutorials, an 'about' section, and a forum. 

## Getting started
As a collaborator, you are free to work on any component of the website. 
The project plans are displayed in the 'Projects' tab of this repository. 
- View the items in the _'To Do' list_ to see what needs to be done 
- Move any items on which you're working across into the _'In Progress'_ tab
- The task will be moved to _'Done'_ once the code is merged into the master branch. 

## How to contribute
See what needs to be done within the Projects tab, and what is currently in progress. Consider what has been started and needs finishing, what tasks would logically follow those that have been completed, or what your skills are suited towards.

Clone the repository to your account and create a new branch for your contributions. 
Commit the changes and push to GitHub. Create a pull request to submit changes for review. 

If you're not sure where to start, consider: 
* Design
* Responsiveness
* API integration
* User interactivity
* Performance

Our website also has a 'resources' page, where members can share helpful tools and articles related to web development (e.g. video tutorials, Medium posts, useful tools) or even members' own original resources (think screencasts, slides, videos, blog posts, etc). 

## Pull requests & merging
